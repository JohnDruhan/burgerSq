This app is deployed on Heroku here: https://apricot-pie-45454.herokuapp.com/

A full stack web application using MySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars, Node and Express that allows the user to log the burgers they would like to eat.  The user can also input their name and then "devour" the burger, that name will be stored in a seperate table from the burger.


Open app and type in name of burger and press "submit":
